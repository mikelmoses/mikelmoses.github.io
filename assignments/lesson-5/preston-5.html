                <h3>This week summary</h3>
                <p> <img src="images/idaho-image.jpg" alt="idaho">
                Tonight through Sunday. We are still watching our
main area of snow slowing working east this afternoon. We should
finally see it shifting east of I-15 by late afternoon/early
evening. Accumulations haven`t been terribly high, but where it
has been a bit heavier...we are seeing some slushy or slick
roads. There is some blowing snow as winds are picking up, but
impacts appear to be limited especially where it`s remained warmer
and snow is wet. It is also helping that road temperatures are
quite warm and many roads remain wet. Elsewhere, as main low takes
shape across the Pacific Northwest...this will keep showers going
across the central mountains going. There could be some brief
impacts where snow falls heavy enough to drop visibility and
create slick conditions.For almost 20 years, Intellicast has provided 
expert weather information to pilots, marine professionals, government 
organizations, media outlets and weather savvy individuals across the world. 
Through our advanced research and sophisticated radar and forecasting 
technology, we’ve been able to offer consumers highly advanced weather products. 
As you may know, Intellicast has been part of The Weather Company for quite some time now. 
Since joining The Weather Company in 2012, our organization has worked closely with fellow 
weather service provider Weather Underground, known for hyper-local weather data and its 
large global network of personal weather stations. Later in 2015, IBM acquired The Weather 
Company. This change showed a next step in that continued evolution, while continuing to 
offer superior forecasting and weather products to consumers and businesses.
As both Weather Underground and Intellicast are committed to providing the 
most accurate, local weather information possible, it was quickly evident 
that combining our data networks, advanced technologies and engineering 
resources would allow for enhanced accuracy and usability of our products, radar and forecasts.</p>
