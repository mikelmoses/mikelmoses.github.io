        Announced on May 25, 2006, the temple is located on a 10-acre (40,000 m2) 
        site at 200 Street and 82 Avenue in the suburb of Langley. Groundbreaking was 
        held on August 4, 2007.[4] A public open house was held 9–24 April 2010 prior to 
        the dedication of the temple on 2 May 2010.[5] Following dedication, only church
        members in good standing may enter an LDS temple. In the LDS Church, a temple is 
        a building dedicated to be a House of the Lord, and considered by church members 
        to be the most sacred structures on earth. Upon completion, temples are usually 
        open to the public for a short period of time (an "open house"), and then each is 
        dedicated as a "House of the Lord," after which only members in good standing are 
        permitted to enter. Thus, they are not churches or meetinghouses, but rather 
        specialized places of worship. There are 162 dedicated temples (152 currently open; 
        and 11 previously dedicated, but closed for renovation), 12 under construction, and 
        27 announced (not yet under construction). Within temples, members of the church make 
        covenants, receive instructions, and perform rituals and ordinances. Additionally, members 
        consider the temple a place to commune with God, seek God’s aid, understand His will, and 
        receive personal revelation.</p>
